				<h2>From Nothing to Impact</h2>
				<p>How a laptop, a dream, and relentless belief built a career transforming lives through code</p>

				<div class="mission-card">
					<h3>My Why</h3>
					<p>I'm Wael Hajji ‚Äî not just a full-stack instructor, but someone who's always dreamed bigger. My
						goal was never just to learn how to code ‚Äî it was to change lives with it. That's why I teach,
						lead, and build: to create real impact.</p>

					<p>I've mentored over 250 developers, and I'm just getting started. My mission? Build something that
						lasts ‚Äî my own edtech company, my own product, my own dream. I'm obsessed with empowering people
						where opportunity is scarce.</p>

					<div class="quote-highlight">
						"I don't want to follow trends ‚Äî I want to create them. I believe tech should lift people up.
						That's the future I'm building."
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>The Beginning</h3>
				<p>I didn't start with much. No connections, no roadmap ‚Äî just a laptop, a dream, and a deep belief that
					I was meant to do something meaningful.</p>

				<p>At first, I was just another student trying to figure it out. No one knew my name, and opportunities
					felt a world away. But I held onto one hope: that if someone gave me a chance, I'd prove them right
					‚Äî and never let them down.</p>

				<div class="journey-timeline">
					<div class="timeline-marker">1</div>
					<div class="timeline-content">
						<h4>The Turning Point</h4>
						<p>That chance came when I joined Nefel Education/Coding Dojo US ‚Äî not as a student this time,
							but as a Teaching
							Assistant. An international company. A dream I used to only read about. And suddenly‚Ä¶ I was
							part of it.</p>
						<p>Someone believed in me ‚Äî and because I believed in myself too, I rose to meet the challenge.
							I gave it everything: my time, my energy, my heart. I wasn't just supporting students ‚Äî I
							was building futures. And in doing so, I was building mine too.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="timeline-marker">2</div>
					<div class="timeline-content">
						<h4>The Acceleration</h4>
						<p>From there, the journey accelerated. I became an Instructor, then a TA Lead, and now ‚Äî an
							Instructional Support Manager.</p>
						<p>I've spent the last 3+ years in tech education, growing not just in title but in purpose.
							I've taught in full-time and part-time programs, led diverse teaching teams, and mentored
							hundreds of students in MERN, Python, and C# .NET stacks.</p>

				<h3>Beyond Code</h3>
				<p>For me, this has never just been about code:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>It's about showing someone they can</strong> - Believing in people before they believe
						in themselves</li>
					<li><strong>Turning fear into confidence</strong> - Watching impostor syndrome transform into
						capability</li>
					<li><strong>Lighting sparks that become fires</strong> - Seeing students surpass their own
						expectations</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="quote-highlight">
					"Because I know what it's like to start from zero ‚Äî and I've made it my mission to help others rise
					beyond that, just like I did."
				</div>

				<h3>The Future</h3>
				<p>Every day, I show up to build something bigger than myself. I don't just teach ‚Äî I transform. I don't
					just lead ‚Äî I lift.</p>
				<p>And I'm not done yet. The journey is far from over. The next chapter is still being written ‚Äî and if
					you're reading this, maybe we'll build something amazing together.</p>
